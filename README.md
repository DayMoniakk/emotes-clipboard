## Informations

This is a simple project I made to pratice the Svelte framework.
I'm not a professional developer, I never learned programming at school so my code is clearly not the best optimized code possible but I'm trying to figure out how things are working =)

## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
